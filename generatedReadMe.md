    ## Installation

    Access my github and readme-generator-hw repo, then clone onto your computer

    ## Usage 

    using your preferred coding software, open the readme-generator-hw folder and access the index.js file using your terminal. Run node index.js, and answer all of the prompts to the best of your ability with as much detail as possible. A generatedReadMe.md file will be generated, from which you can copy into a finalized README.md file and attach any screenshots or videos necessary before uploading.
