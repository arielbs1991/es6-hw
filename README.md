    ## Description

    A user is prompted to answer a series of questions about their application. Those answers are then used to generate a formatted and professional readme file. The prompts are generated using the npm Inquirer [link to docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), and run using node.js.

    ## Installation

    Access my github and readme-generator-hw repo at https://github.com/arielbs1991, then clone onto your computer using your preferred terminal.

    ## Usage 

    Using your preferred coding software, open the readme-generator-hw folder and access the index.js file within your terminal. Run node index.js, and answer all of the prompts to the best of your ability with as much detail as possible. A generatedReadMe.md file will be generated, from which you can copy into a finalized README.md file and attach any screenshots or videos necessary before uploading alongside your application.

    ## Credits

    Joe and Denis's lectures in the coding bootcamp program, and collaboration with classmates.
